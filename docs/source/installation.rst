Installation
---------------------------

From PyPI (recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install from PyPI: ::

    pip install --user STMint


To install system-wide, omit the ``--user`` option. This requires administrative privileges on most systems.

From GitHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If cloning from github, in the cloned grading directory: ::


    pip install --user .

or, to install in developer mode: ::


    pip install --user -e .


.. note::

    To upgrade to the latest version, just append ``--upgrade`` to whichever install command you originally used.  For example: ``pip install --upgrade --user STMint``.
